# Ecommerce-Project
This is a mock e-commerce site. It allows an admin to create an account, sign in, and then make and update their products. It allows customers to create an account, add items to their cart, and purchase those items.

## CREDIT
I completed this project as part of an online course taught by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider.

## Skills I Learned 
- Implementing "production grade" password security
- Creating a "from scratch" database. This is not an actual solution I would use but it was a good learning experience 
- Creating the database from scratch taught me a lot about efficient and in effciient data structures 
- Creating a shopping cart
- Uploading images to a database
